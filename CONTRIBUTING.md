# Contributing to Spectre

- Keep pull requests small and focused.
- If you change data formats, update/add schema validations.
- Do **not** introduce live trading or execution code without explicit discussion.
- Never commit secrets or keys. Use a local .env file (which is gitignored) if needed.
- Always run the pipeline before submitting a pull request.
